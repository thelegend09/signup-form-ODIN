# Signup Form
I made this form for The Odin Project.

## What I learned
- It is possible to use the mechanism of a checkbox while hiding the checkbox itself, and only use the label. That's what I did under the "Previous Website Experience" header.
- It is possible to use very complex CSS selectors. That's what I used to customize the fields when they were valid/invalid. ([credit](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-ux-html-css/#aa-sub-trick-testing-if-an-input-has-a-value-or-not))


## What I need to do better
- Organize my CSS code
- Commit more intelligently and often
- Use calc() and clamp() and the other CSS functions
- Use Flex

## This form is not perfect
It is certainly not mobile friendly. And I can't for the life of me find a way to make it shrink gracefully without the empty space on the right taking so much space.
